Description: For Bayesian and classical inference and prediction with integer-valued data,
    Simultaneous Transformation and Rounding (STAR) Models provide a flexible, interpretable,
    and easy-to-use approach. STAR models the observed count data using a rounded 
    continuous data model and incorporates a transformation for greater flexibility.
    Implicitly, STAR formalizes the commonly-applied yet incoherent procedure of 
    (i) transforming integer-valued data and subsequently 
    (ii) modeling the transformed data using Gaussian models. 
    STAR is well-defined for integer-valued data, 
    which is reflected in predictive accuracy, and is designed to account for 
    zero-inflation, bounded or censored data, and over- or underdispersion. 
    Importantly, STAR is easy to combine with existing MCMC or point estimation
    methods for continuous data, which allows seamless adaptation of continuous data
    models (such as linear regressions, additive models, BART, random forests,
    and gradient boosting machines) for integer-valued data. The package also includes several
    methods for modeling count-valued time series data, namely via warped Dynamic Linear Models.
