\description{
Compute MCMC samples from the posterior and predictive
distributions of a STAR linear regression model with a g-prior.
Compared to the Monte Carlo sampler \code{STAR_gprior}, this
function incorporates a prior (and sampling step) for the latent
data standard deviation.
}
\details{
STAR defines a count-valued probability model by
(1) specifying a Gaussian model for continuous *latent* data and
(2) connecting the latent data to the observed data via a
*transformation and rounding* operation. Here, the continuous
latent data model is a linear regression.

There are several options for the transformation. First, the transformation
can belong to the *Box-Cox* family, which includes the known transformations
'identity', 'log', and 'sqrt'. Second, the transformation
can be estimated (before model fitting) using the empirical distribution of the
data \code{y}. Options in this case include the empirical cumulative
distribution function (CDF), which is fully nonparametric ('np'), or the parametric
alternatives based on Poisson ('pois') or Negative-Binomial ('neg-bin')
distributions. For the parametric distributions, the parameters of the distribution
are estimated using moments (means and variances) of \code{y}. The distribution-based
transformations approximately preserve the mean and variance of the count data \code{y}
on the latent data scale, which lends interpretability to the model parameters.
Lastly, the transformation can be modeled using the Bayesian bootstrap ('bnp'),
which is a Bayesian nonparametric model and incorporates the uncertainty
about the transformation into posterior and predictive inference.

# Simulate some data:
sim_dat = simulate_nb_lm(n = 100, p = 10)
y = sim_dat$y; X = sim_dat$X

# Fit a linear model:
fit = STAR_gprior_gibbs(y, X)
