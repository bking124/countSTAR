## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. The previous version was archived due to an error caused from the package rstanarm, which the vignette depends on. 

I thought the issue would resolve itself (the rstanarm developers released a fix), but perhaps that didn't propagate to my package. This update removes any dependence on rstanarm, and adds a dataset to the package.
